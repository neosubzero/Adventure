- instead of the magic numbers 0,1,2,3 to index into the exits array to get the connecting room, it is better to use named constants.  This makes the logic more readily understandable.  NORTH=0, EAST=1, WEST=2 SOUTH=3.
currentRoom = exits[currentRoom][NORTH];
currentRoom = exits[currentRoom][EAST];
currentRoom = exits[currentRoom][WEST];
currentRoom = exits[currentRoom][SOUTH];
